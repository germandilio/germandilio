Here are my pet projects, that were made while studying at HSE University.
There aren't represent my current experience at all, but some of them look quite solid and fundamental, like my own [Json Parser](https://github.com/germandilio/JSON-Parser).
Especially challenging was an [RPG Game](https://github.com/germandilio/RPG-Deep-Dive) project. At the developing time, it was a severe architectural challenge to develop an entity component base architecture with loosely coupled subsystems and high cohesion components among the subsystems.
